## Description of features
VI_pro this is a joint project with https://github.com/Sthdire . The idea of the project is to create a website for the sale sweets on Django+SQL. The site has a home page, a selling page, an order page and registration.
The main feature of this project is that I worked with the Django admin panel and added logic for user registration and login, and also wrote some things depending on the userâ€™s state. My friend, in turn, worked hard on the design and, as its main feature, added beautiful animation on the main page using animeJS. Please note that the animation is accurate to the pixel)
